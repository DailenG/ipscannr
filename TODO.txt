ok here's the todos for later:                                                                                                                           
  - Bug: right now if I hit 'q' while the range pane is selected right after the app first initializes, it changes "focus" to the "Hosts" pane for         
  some reason, and I hit it one more time then it quits.                                                                                                   
  - Feat: if I hit the backspace while in the range pane then it should immediately change it to "custom" range and let me edit the current contents       
  - Feat (later): i'd like to be able to use the spacebar to select multiple entries that can be collectively exported                                     
  - Feat (later): when viewing the "Host Details" I'd like to be able to execute additional functions such as Wake On Lan, scan for common ports, ping     
  continuiously and display the ping results somehow, run tracert, save details         



TODO:
  - Feat: Backspace in range pane → custom edit mode                                                                                                       
  - Multi-select with spacebar for batch export
